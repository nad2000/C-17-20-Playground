# C++17/20 Playground

Notes from "Learn Advanced C++ Programming", other courses and just mocking around...

Some of the experiments are supplied with the [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) unit tests.

To compile, run:

```sh

clang++ --std=c++2a -Wall -Wno-dynamic-exception-spec -O0 -g FILE.cpp

```
